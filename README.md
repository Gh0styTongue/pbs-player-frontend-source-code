# pbs-player frontend source code archive

Extracted from pbs-player. Saved using the Chrome extension [Save All Resources](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-all-resources/abpdnfjocnmdomablahdcfnoggeeiedb).

### How is this possible?

Because PBS forgot to disable sourcemaps in production on the pbs-player 🙃

I've archived them here on GitHub for educational purposes.
